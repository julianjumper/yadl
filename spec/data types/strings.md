# Strings
`string_lit`


Strings are enclosed by `" "`, `' '` or `f" "` (or `"""` idk weil das ist nervig). If they are opened with `f"` they are a formatted string and can do cool things (to be continued).

```
"Hallo Welt"
'Hello World!'
```





# String Arithmetic



### Operators
`+`: takes two strings and appends the second string to the first. If used with a non-string, that gets converted to a string.
`*`: takes a string and a int x, returning the string x times
`[]`: insert array access
