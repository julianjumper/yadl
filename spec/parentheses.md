# Parentheses

Parentheses () can be used to surround a statement. Statements in parenthese gain highest precedence and happen before any other statement in the Expression

Example:
```
x = 3 * (2 + 3)
x == 15
```
Here, `2 + 3` is executed before multiplying the result by `5`, event though multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. This happens because of parentheses
