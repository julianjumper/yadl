# Significant Whitespace

Statements are seperated via a newline

Example:
```
x = 1 + 2
y = 3 + x
```

Here, the assingment of values to x and y are different statements, as they happen on different lines.

In order to have multiple lines interpreted in one Statement, you can wrap them in parentheses.

Example:
```
x = ("Hello"
    + "World)
```
